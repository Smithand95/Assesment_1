            <p id='p1'>C.R.A.B is a nonprofit organisation set up by myself and a number of other co-founders, together we formed the Crustaceans Rights Activists Bureau!, the organisation was originally founded in response to culling of the russian king crab, however
                our remit has expanded to focusing on the development of sustainable crustacean farming methods, that take into account their ecological impact to other more protected species. we are not against responsible and sustainable farming of
                crustaceans, some species are delicious and under no threat of extinction. Our key aims involve educating the public about responsible crabbing/lobster fishing, increasing awareness of the more endangered species, and to discourage
                culling, encouraging productive usage of that meat.

                we try to do this by keeping up to date information on all goings on crustaceans, if we miss something, we tend to get a bit crabby, i hope you learn something from this site and treat your crustacean friends with the respect they deserve.
